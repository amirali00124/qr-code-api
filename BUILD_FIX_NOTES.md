# Build Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
The build was failing with:
```
sh: line 1: vite: command not found
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 127
```

## Root Cause
- Complex build script trying to build both frontend and backend
- Vercel only needs frontend build for static files
- API functions are handled separately as serverless functions

## Fix Applied
**Before:**
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
```

**After:**
```json
"build": "vite build"
```

## Dependencies Verified
✅ `vite` is in devDependencies  
✅ `esbuild` is in devDependencies  
✅ All React build tools are available  
✅ Simplified build process for Vercel  

## Result
- Frontend builds correctly with Vite
- API functions deploy as serverless functions 
- No more "command not found" errors
- Clean deployment process
